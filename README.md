# lum.app.php

## Summary

A collection of libraries for MVC-style apps.

Has abstract classes, utility classes, and modular traits for both controllers

This is one of the packages that replaces the older [lum-framework] package.

## Extensions

Database-specific model classes are in their own packages:

 * [PDO/SQL](https://github.com/supernovus/lum.app-pdo.php)
 * [MongoDB](https://github.com/supernovus/lum.app-mongo.php)
